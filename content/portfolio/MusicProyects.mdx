## Bichonauta
As an indie band from Santiago, they landed in the stages with stories to tell with a lot of bugs flying around and looking for some fun and good memories. They appear from the dark with noisy noises from the speakers, and the weird clothes gives a teatrical scent to the air. That's how Bichonauta start a show, and by the energy that they spread to the audience you can notice how awesome they wanted to make his shows, this effort was transformed into an album and some videos. You can listen Bichonauta here.

## Tormenta China
It all started with the storm, this weird rock band was an intend to make the failure an entire proyect, and we did it. A complete failure of music converted into a success. You can listen this loss, full of cracks, glitchy waste but fun and awesome music here.

## Caracol
After making some adjustments to the sound I decided to upload some rare tapes I wrote some time ago, maybe you enjoy to listen music from distant places, or lost tapes founded from a cold desert. If that's the case then this is for you.

## Quebrada Radiocontrol
With some friends we make a lot of musical experiments, we recorded some of those jams and recording sessions as we looked for the sound that will chase another sound as they chase us while we run looking for anything that can make a sound until a surprising sound finally melts us.
